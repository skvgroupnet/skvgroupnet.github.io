### Updating Progress Status

Keeping your project status accurate is simple with Project Progress Tracker:

1. Drag or adjust the indicator to reflect the current progress of your project.
2. Team members can update the Completion Percentage to show how much of the project they believe is complete (e.g., from 20% to 30%).
3. Change the Project Status to reflect overall progress. Choose from three options: On Track (Green), Some Risk (Yellow), or Concerned (Red).
4. Click Submit to confirm the update.

This manual update provides a true reflection of where your project stands, beyond automated progress bars
